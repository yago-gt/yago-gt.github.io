    "dummybirdDesc": "This project was the first full game that I did. The game is a clone of the mobile game <strong>Flappy Bird</strong> using the <strong>LÖVE</strong> framework with the <strong>Lua</strong> scripting language. It uses <strong>object oriented programming</strong> to model in-game object like the bird, sky and the pipes. The game is free to download in Itch.io and the source code can be found in GitHub.",
